Bangalore is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. It has a population of about 8.42 million and a metropolitan population of about 8.52 million, making it the third most populous city and fifth most populous urban agglomeration in India.[5] It is located in southern India on the Deccan Plateau. Its elevation is over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, the highest of India's major cities.[12]

A succession of South Indian dynasties, the Western Gangas, the Cholas and the Hoysalas, ruled the present region of Bangalore until in 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore</p>

Located in the foothills of the Chamundi Hills about 146 km (91 mi) southwest of the state capital Bangalore, it is spread across an area of 128.42 km2 (50 sq mi). According to the provisional results of the 2011 national census of India, the population is 887,446. Mysore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration of the city, which is also the headquarters of the Mysore district and the Mysore division.

Mysore served as the capital city of the Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries, from 1399 until 1956</p>

<br>
<p style="text-indent:5em">
Madikeri is a hill station town in Karnataka state, India. Also known as Mercara, it is the headquarters of the district of Kodagu (also called Coorg). It is a popular tourist destination..The history of Madikeri is related to the history of Kodagu. From the 2nd to the 6th century AD, the northern part of Kodagu was ruled by Kadambas. The southern part of Kodagu was ruled by Gangas from the 4th to the 11th century. After defeating the Gangas in the 11th century, Cholas became the rulers of Kodagu. In the 12th century, the Cholas lost Kodagu to the Hoysalas. Kodagu fell to the Vijayanagar kings in the 14th century</p>

<br>
<p style="text-indent:5em">
Hampi (Hampe) is a village and temple town recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed as the Group of Monuments at Hampi.[3] in northern Karnataka, India. It is located within the ruins of the city of Vijayanagara, the former capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. Predating the city of Vijayanagara, Hampi continues to be an important religious centre, housing the Virupaksha Temple and several other monuments belonging to the old city.Emperor Ashoka's Rock Edicts in Nittur & Udegolan (both in Bellary district) suggest that this region was part of the Maurya Empire during the 3rd century BC. A Brahmi inscription and a terracotta seal dating to the II century CE were also recovered from the excavation site.

<font color="#660000"; size="5">Gokarna</font>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:5em">
Gokarna is a small temple town on the western coast of India in the Kumta taluk of Uttara Kannada district of the state of Karnataka.[1] The main temple and deity is Lord Shiva, who is also known as Mahabaleshwara. This temple houses what is believed to be original image of Lord Shiva's linga (Atmalinga). There are many other temples all over this small town. Ankola and Kumta on National Highway 17 are the main towns near Gokarna and Bhatkal and Karwar are the main cities near Gokarna where almost all trains stops.

Gokarna is known as one of the seven important Hindu pilgrimage centers. It is on what was once an unspoiled beach near the estuary of the river Aghanashini. Recently, due to the influx of tourists, the character of the town has changed; it is no longer just a centre of pilgrimage, though large numbers of devotees visit to offer prayers and worship to Lord Shiva.</p>
<font color="#660000"; size="5">Bijapur</font>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:5em">
While archaeological evidence indicates that the area was settled by the late Paleolithic,[2] 
the legendary founding of the city of Bijapur was in the late 900s under Tailapa II, who had been the Rashtrakutan governor of 
Tardavadi,[3] and after the destruction to the empire caused by the invasion of the Paramara of Malwa, declared his independence and
 went on to found the empire of the Chalukyas of Kalyani,[4] where the city was referred as Vijayapura ("City of Victory").[5][6] By
 the late 13th century, the area had come under the influence of the Khilji Sultanate. In 1347, the area was conquered by the Bahmani
 Sultanate of Gulbarga. By this time the city was being referred as Vijapur or Bijapur.In 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate split into five
 splinter states known as the Deccan sultanates, one of which was Bijapur, ruled by the kings of the Adil Shahi dynasty (1490–1686). 
 The city of Bijapur owes much of its greatness to Yusuf Adil Shah, the founder of the independent Bijapur Sultanate. The rule of this 
 dynasty ended in 1686, when Bijapur was conquered by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.
